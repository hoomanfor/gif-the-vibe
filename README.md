# Gif the Vibe

Check it out: [Gif the Vibe](https://hoomanfor.github.io/gif-the-vibe/)

Click on "Positive" or "Happy" to see some positive or happy gifs. Using the GIPHY API, I display gifs. The user can add a custom button using the form input in the header. There's also a favorites section where users can store their favorite gifs. Additionally, clicking on the gifs will stop and start animation.

Gif it a go :-D
